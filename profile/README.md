### Control Infrastructure for AI Agents
Fencio governs planning, context, and execution. It applies microservice rigor to autonomous systems.

**Ongoing Private Beta**
- Invite-only onboarding keeps feedback loops tight while we harden Guard, Probe, and Trace.
- Priority goes to teams running multi-agent workflows who need layered safety without throttling scale.

**What Fencio Promises**
- **Control Infra**: an opinionated stack that wraps your agents with segmentation from L0 input through L6 runtime actions.
- **Deploy Safely**: deterministic guardrails translate policies into enforced behavior before unsafe actions ship.
- **Scale Intelligently**: telemetry and evals evolve with the agent, so coverage grows instead of decaying.

**Three Pillars Highlighted Up Front**
1. `Probe` — reconstructs agents, stress-tests every layer, and surfaces broken guardrails fast.
2. `Guard` — inline policy enforcement and escalation logic so unsafe actions are blocked, rewritten, or routed.
3. `Trace` — automated eval generation from real production traces; gold runs stay fresh as behavior shifts.
